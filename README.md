UC Berkeley Week 1 Challenge

# Code Cleanup Challenge for Marketing Agency

This project aims to improve the codebase of a website belonging to a marketing agency to ensure it meets accessibility standards. It aims to optimize the site for search engines, resulting in more organic traffic and a higher ranking in search results.

## User Story

As a marketing agency, we want our codebase to follow accessibility standards. This ensures that our site is optimized for search engines, improving our visibility and accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

The project is successful when the following criteria are met:

- **Semantic HTML elements:** The source code of the webpage includes semantic HTML elements, which makes the site more understandable and accessible.
- **Logical structure:** The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical pattern, independent of styling and positioning. This logical structure helps screen reader users understand the content and navigation of the page.
- **Accessible alt attributes:** All image elements on the webpage have appropriate alt attributes. These alt descriptions are critical for visually impaired users who use screen readers to understand the content of images on the page.
- **Sequential heading order:** The heading elements on the webpage fall in a sequential order. A well-structured document with properly ordered headings helps users navigate the page content, particularly those using screen readers.
- **Descriptive title:** The title element of the webpage is concise and descriptive. This aids users in understanding the content of the page before they visit it, and helps with SEO and bookmarking.
